I had used a pre-trained PyTorch model for language modeling. It demonstrates how to load the model, tokenize input sentences, and make predictions for a masked token. 

First we have to importing necessary libraries and defining the main class, "Pytorchmodel." Inside the main method, a sample sentence is defined. The HuggingFaceTokenizer is used to tokenize the input sentences using a tokenizer model stored in a JSON file.

The tokenized sentences are then processed to find the index of the masked token ("<mask>"). If no masked token is found, the program exits. Otherwise, the index is stored in the variable "maskTokenIndex."

Next, the input tensors for the model are prepared by extracting the input IDs and attention mask from the token encodings. The environment and session for the ONNX (“Open Neural Network Exchange”) runtime are created, and the model is loaded from an ONNX file.

The input tensors are created using the input IDs and attention mask, and a map of input names to tensor values is created. The model is then run using the provided inputs.

The predictions for the masked token are retrieved from the output of the model. The top predicted token indices are obtained using the helper function "getTopKIndices," which selects the highest-scoring indices from the predictions.

The masked token value is retrieved using the input IDs, and the top predicted tokens are obtained by decoding the predicted token IDs. Finally, the masked token value and top predicted tokens are printed.

Overall, the code showcases the process of using a pre-trained PyTorch model for language modeling, including tokenization, model loading, input preparation, model execution, and result extraction.
